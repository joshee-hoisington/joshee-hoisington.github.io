Something that I'm interested in exploring is how people are allowed to express themselves, or what is acceptable to put forward from out private lives into the public sphere.  I am interested in finding a way to discuss the fact that I am a very lonely person, without making it an exercise in seeking attention, or necessarily making people feel bad for me.  And I'm interested in broadening that conversation to include other people who feel like I do.<br>
I live my life as a single person.  And it's OK.  I get by.  But it is not what I want.  There are reasons I have remained single for all but a few months of my life; I'm very shy, I probably have a form of autism, I have specific interests that few others do, I'm smarter than most people but I don't look as physically attractive as most people, either.<br>
However, I'm a pretty great person.  So this is just going to be a little advertisement for myself.  We'll see what happens.<br><br>
